	abstract = {This paper presents a method for sentiment
		analysis specifically designed to work with
		Twitter data (tweets), taking into account their
		structure, length and specific language. The
		approach employed makes it easily extendible
		to other languages and makes it able to process
		tweets in near real time. The main contributions
		of this work are: a) the pre-processing
		of tweets to normalize the language and generalize
		the vocabulary employed to express sentiment;
		b) the use minimal linguistic processing,
		which makes the approach easily portable
		to other languages; c) the inclusion of higher
		order n-grams to spot modifications in the polarity
		of the sentiment expressed; d) the use of
		simple heuristics to select features to be employed;
		e) the application of supervised learning
		using a simple Support Vector Machines
		linear classifier on a set of realistic data. We
		show that using the training models generated
		with the method described we can improve
		the sentiment classification performance, irrespective
		of the domain and distribution of the
		test sets.
