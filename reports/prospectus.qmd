## Intro

The field of community interpreting, which involves facilitating communication in everyday settings such as lawyers' offices, doctor's surgeries, and school orientations [@hale2007community], has experienced significant growth since World War II due to increased migration [@pochhacker1999getting]. However, in China, community interpreting is still in its early stages [@Liu2014], primarily concentrated in areas such as law, medical care, and administration [@Luo2018]. Community interpreting extends beyond language translation to encompass social work as well [@gehrke1990community], adding complexity to the role of community interpreters [@pollabauer2013community]. In recent years, esports has undergone industrialization, evolving into a legitimate “Made in China” industry. It has become a trendy form of entertainment and sports consumption [@Zhao2023HistoryESports]. This shift was exemplified at the Hangzhou Asian Games this year when esports made its official debut as a competitive event on the global stage. During the opening ceremony of the 141st IOC Session on October 14th, 2023, International Olympic Committee President Bach hinted at the IOC’s contemplation of establishing a dedicated Olympic event for esports [@Qiu2023enterOly]. 

## Research problem

Previous studies have primarily addressed discrepancies between interpreters’ role perceptions and users’ expectations (e.g. @Ma2021T19) or highlighted challenges and coping strategies for interpreters within the esports domain (e.g. @Ruan2019LOL; @Zhao2019AsiEsports). Limited attention has been paid to interpreters’ specific roles within the esports domain. Li & Gao (2021) noted that research on interpreter roles in China tends to confine itself to textual analysis, focusing on the translation content itself, seeking rules and guidance within interpreting practices. [@bao2016using] utilized multimodal analysis to include linguistic and non-linguistic information to analyze interpreters role in different cases. [@hlavac2017brokers] utilized discourse markers to determine interpreters role in different settings. [@hsieh2012medical] applied the comparative analysis to analyze the interviews' transcripts of interpreters and health care providers. [@kratochvilovasociolinguistic] also focused on healthcare setting where combining interpreting transcripts'analysis and interpreters' interview. The focus of analyzing interpreters' role in transcripts shows a potential to explore interpreters' role from non-lingistic level.

I see where you are going here. It sounds like a promising area of research. However, at this stage, you've only identified the lack of study in this area --not an approach to study this area.

I would suggest you delve more into the studies that have approached community interpreting in China, or elsewhere, through text/ corpus analysis methods. What were their findings? What were their limitations? What were their methodologies? These are the types of questions that will lead you to a more specific research question.

-->


## Research questions

(@) What role is considered most acceptable for esports interpreters in China?
(@) What role do esports interpreters primarily play in China?

<!--

As I suggested in the comment above, more concrete corpus-based text analysis studies will help you to refine your research questions such that they are more specific and answerable.

This stage is difficult, and I don't expect you (or anyone) to have a fully formed research question at this stage. But with this attempt, you can see where you need to go next.

I look forward to seeing how you refine your research questions in the next draft.

-->


## Research objectives

Exploring the role of community interpreters to potentially help the general public to notice community interpreters' position and to understand their work

<!--

OK. So 'standardization' is something more concrete. But what do you mean by 'standardization'? How can you measure it? What are the criteria for standardization? Are there suggested differences in populations, settings, or languages in which community interpreters work that have been suggested to require different standards?

These are only some of the questions that occur to me when I read your research objectives. You'll know best

-->

## Expected impact

(@) To broaden research methodologies for analyzing the role of community interpreters in China, as the majority of studies focus on interpreting transcripts, particularly interpreting strategies [@LiGao2021].
(@) Boosting interpreters' notice to their roles in community interpreting and educating the general public about interpreters' work.

<!--

It is good to have a clear idea of the impact of your research. This will help guide your research to ensure that it is relevant and useful.

# Assessment

## What did you learn?

*  The problem statement is aimed at uncovering the research gap.
*  The research aim is aligned with the purpose of the study, whether it is to explore, predict, or verify.
*  The research problem primarily dictates the focus of inquiry and influences the selection of data.

## What did you find most/ least challenging?

The most challenging aspect for me is identifying research gaps, particularly as I need to review literature from both China and English-speaking countries. Often, I find it difficult to extract detailed findings solely from the abstracts, which requires me to read the full text, a process that can be time-consuming.

## What resources did you consult?

I reviewed the books and PowerPoint presentations used by Professor Furmanek during the interpreting studies course. Additionally, I explored Google Scholar and  [CNKI](https://www.cnki.net/index/) to conduct a literature review and gather insights on potential research topics.

## What questions or concerns do you have at this point?

I believe it would be challenging to acquire the corpus. From my research, I've observed that previous studies on the role of community interpreters often created their own corpus. For example, @bao2016using selected six videos with various settings as the corpus, while @Jiang2021 built the corpus based on her interpreting experiences with government organizations. It's also worth noting that in settings like courtrooms, privacy concerns for both defendants and plaintiffs may prevent the sharing of recordings with the public [@Cao2018].

## What do you need to address in order to move forward?

I need to specify the setting for community interpreting, which could encompass legal, healthcare, education, religious, and various other settings. In addition, I need to select a perspective to guide me, whether it's the interpreters' verbal expression, gestures, or voice modulation, which can indicate their role.
